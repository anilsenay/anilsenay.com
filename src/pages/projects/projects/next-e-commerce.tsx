          As a self-challenge, I created an e-commerce website using Next.js in
          one week. There are some issues that I wish to handle later, but I
          have not continued to contribute to the project. Using Firebase as
          backend.

          I saw a UI design on Dribbble by Anton Mikhaltsov. And I wanted to
          code this design. As a challenge to myself, I decided to create a
          fully functional website with NextJS and Firebase as the backend in
          just one week.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of my first projects using Next when I was new to React.
          So I do not think this is a well-coded project. However, based on
          responses from people who contacted me about the project, I believe
          this project will be useful to someone. I hope that someday I will
          refactor this project by implementing new NextJS features with my
          current knowledge.
