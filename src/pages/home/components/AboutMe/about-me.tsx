          Hi, I am AnÄ±l. I am a software engineer at Cimri.

          <br />
          I can describe myself as a Geek. Computer games, movies, comics,
          science fiction and fantasy books are my interests that I spare time
          in my daily life.
          <br />
          <br />I am mainly interested in front-end development by using{" "}
          <b>React</b>, <b>React Native</b> and back-end development by using{" "}
          <b>Golang</b>.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a software developer, my primary focus is building efficient and
          scalable applications that provide a seamless user experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          My expertise also extends to system architecture, backend development,
          and optimizing performance to ensure every component is both robust
          and maintainable.
