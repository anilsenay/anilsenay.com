          Hi, I am AnÄ±l. I am a software engineer at Cimri.
          <br />
          <br />
          I graduated from Marmara University Computer Science & Engineering at
          2022. I've been interested in computers and programming since my
          childhood. Coding and design, which I started with curiosity and
          passion, is now a big part of my life.
          <br />
          <br />
          I can describe myself as a Geek. Computer games, movies, comics,
          science fiction and fantasy books are my interests that I spare time
          in my daily life.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am mainly interested in front-end development by using React, React
          Native and back-end development by using Golang.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a software developer, my primary focus is building efficient and
          scalable applications that provide a seamless user experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          My expertise also extends to system architecture, backend development,
          and optimizing performance to ensure every component is both robust
          and maintainable.
