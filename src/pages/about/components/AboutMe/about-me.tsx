          Hi, I am AnÄ±l. I am a software engineer at Cimri.
          <br />
          <br />
          I graduated from Marmara University Computer Science & Engineering at
          2022. I've been interested in computers and programming since my
          childhood. Coding and design, which I started with curiosity and
          passion, is now a big part of my life.
          <br />
          <br />
          I can describe myself as a Geek. Computer games, movies, comics,
          science fiction and fantasy books are my interests that I spare time
          in my daily life.
          <br />
          <br />
          I took the first step into the software world with web designing at my
          early ages. After dealing with web design for a few years, I had not
          do any development on the web for a long time. In recent years, I am
          working as developer professionally.
          <br />
          <br />I am mainly interested in front-end development by using React,
          React Native and back-end development by using Golang.
